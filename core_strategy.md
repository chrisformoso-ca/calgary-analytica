# Calgary Analytica - Core Strategy

## 🎯 Mission

Calgary professionals waste 60+ minutes gathering data from fragmented sources. We're building the single source of truth for Calgary market intelligence.

## 📊 Core Strategy: One Data Lake, Many Products

Each data source adds 1x value. Connected data sources create 10x value.

**The Network Effect**: More data sources → Better insights → More users → More feedback → Better products → More data sources

## 🛠️ Technical Philosophy: The Boring Quad Stack

**Python + SQLite + PHP + D3.js**

Why this beats modern stacks for solo + AI development:
- **Maximum AI leverage**: Claude knows these deeply
- **Zero build complexity**: Just files, no bundlers
- **Proven reliability**: Decades of stability
- **Low hosting costs**: Runs on $20/month VPS
- **Instant deployment**: Upload and run

The "boring" stack enables the AI partnership to work at maximum efficiency.

## 💰 Low Burn Advantage

Current resources:
- **Development**: Thinkpad T480s + VSCode + WSL
- **AI Partners**: 
  - Claude Web (strategy, research, content creation)
  - Claude Code (development, implementation, debugging)
- **Version Control**: GitHub (code + AI context)
- **Hosting**: Hostinger + WordPress (blog → VPS for apps)
- **Server**: Proxmox (available for staging)

**Role Split:**
- **Claude Web**: Market research, content drafts, strategy refinement, planning
- **Claude Code**: Code generation, file management, technical implementation
- **Together**: Architecture decisions, problem solving, quality control

Monthly burn: ~$50. This AI-augmented workflow is our competitive advantage.

## 📈 Value Creation Activities

**Data Aggregation** (/data-pipeline/)
- Extract from CREB, City APIs, StatsCan
- Scrape alternative data (Reddit sentiment, Google reviews, social comments)
- Add sources based on user needs
- Maintain freshness and reliability
- Cross-reference for insights

**Product Creation** (/web/)
- Build dashboards that save time
- Create tools professionals actually use
- Iterate based on usage patterns
- Compound value across products

**Content Creation** (/content/)
- SEO-optimized Calgary insights
- Methodology documentation
- Data stories and analysis
- AI-first development insights (/content/meta/)
- Build authority and trust

**Key:** These three activities reinforce each other continuously. More data enables better products and content. Better content brings users who request new data. Better products justify more data investment.

## 🎯 Strategic Principles

### Focus
- **Users**: Calgary professionals and decision-makers
- **Data**: Any data relevant to Calgary (includes Edmonton comparisons, Alberta economics, global oil prices)
- **Tech**: Simple over trendy
- **Content**: Documentation IS marketing

### Say No To
- Other cities' users (stay Calgary-focused)
- Data without Calgary relevance
- Trendy tech (increases complexity)
- Premature monetization (reduces access)
- Features outside core vision

### Success Metrics
- Data sources integrated
- Weekly active users
- Time saved per user
- Organic search traffic

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

- **Data source changes**: Build adapters, not dependencies
- **Funded competitor**: They'll burn out, we won't
- **Scaling**: SQLite → PostgreSQL path ready

## 💡 Decision Framework

For every decision:
1. Does this serve Calgary data aggregation?
2. Will AI development stay simple?
3. Can I ship in days, not weeks?
4. Am I solving real problems or imagined ones?

## 🔮 Why This Wins

- **No revenue pressure** = Build the right thing
- **Boring tech** = Less maintenance, more features  
- **Solo + AI** = No coordination overhead
- **Local passion** = Deep domain expertise
- **Patient capital** = Compound advantages

Remember: Patience + low burn + boring tech = unstoppable
